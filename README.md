# HowToBuildAChatbot

### Aim
 In this lesson we want to create a chatbot that can answer the query according to my data provide to llm. This issue get resolved by llama-index. LlamaIndex is an interface between our data and LLM’s.
In this lesson we use Langchain for the underlying Agent/Chatbot abstractions, and we use LlamaIndex for the data retrieval/lookup/querying! The result is a chatbot agent that has access to a rich set of “data interface” Tools that LlamaIndex provides to answer queries over our data.
